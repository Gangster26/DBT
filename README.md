# # ðŸ“Š DBT Homework 7 â€“ Data Warehouse Project

This repository contains the full implementation of **Homework 7** for SP25: DATA-226 â€“ Data Warehousing.  
The goal was to build a dbt project integrated with Snowflake to perform data modeling, testing, and snapshotting.  
All development was done locally using dbt CLI, and each step was documented with screenshots (included in this repo).
